                    Hello, this is my website. You can get to know me through
                    this website. These days the website interface design varies
                    greatly, from minimal design to complex design. Because of
                    the large number of website design choices that make me
                    confused to use what kind of style, eventually I decided to
                    go back to 2000s website design.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The appearance of this website is also what I made when I
                    first learned to make a web page using only HTML and also
                    Notepad. But, because this is 2020 and there are lots of
                    tools that make it easy for us to build a modern website, so
                    I decided to build this website using Node, React/Next and
                    Now; so that people don't think that I'm standing by
                    obsolescence.
                </p>

                <p>
                    As I mentioned before, today we are facilitated by modern
                    tools, such as Node, Tailwind, React, Vue, Gatsby, Webpack,
                    and so on. Because of these tools, sometimes someone thinks
                    creating a website today is complicated: because we have to
                    setup "this and that"; maybe it's true. On the other hand, I
                    just want to "prove" that making website is easy, "these
                    tools" are literally tools. So, without these tools we can
                    still create a website. Also, when we need these tools, use
                    them. Simple isn't it?
                </p>

                <p>
                    The most important thing is that I am just an ordinary human
                    whose every statement is potentially wrong - just like you.
